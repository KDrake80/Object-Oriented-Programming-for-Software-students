##  Object Oriented Proramming for Software Students
I created this to store all of my assignments in this class. That way I can access them to turn them in, and change them when needed.

My name is **Kevin Drake**, I am a student at **Southwest Technical College**. I will soon be *30* years old. I am hoping to have a family someday.
    
I am taking this Program so I can design software and apps as a career. **I have always wanted to write programs, and work with computers.**
