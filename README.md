##  Object Oriented Proramming for Software Students
    I created this to store all of my assignments in this class. That way I can access them to turn them in, and change them when needed.

    My name is __Kevin Drake__, I am a student at __Southwest Technical College__. I will soon be _30_ years old. I am hoping to have a family someday.
    
    I am taking this Program so I can design software and apps as a career. I have always wanted to write programs, and work with computers.
